# Legally suspicious implementation of MacOS

I created this website to achieve two things

1.  Serve as my portfolio
2.  Replicate the MacOS user experience

I took inspiration (read: blatantly stole) from the latest MacOS design (I think, Sonoma? With some borrowed elements from previous versions?) and incorporated some of my own details into it. I have always admired the simplicity of the platform and Apple's ability to make clean UIs.

# Technologies

-   Framework: Next.js (React)
-   Styling: Tailwindcss
-   Animations: React Spring & @use-gesture/react

# Contributions?

Sure lmao. Feel free to suggest something

# What's next?

I have several things planned to slowly rollout

1. at certain breakpoints, change from a Mac screen, then to an Ipad screen, then finally to an Iphone
2. I dunno, something else?

# Notes

1. Backdrop blur bug with Firefox (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1803813)
2. Scale animations require a small translateZ property to work properly in Firefox
